# granary — Agent Guide

Pure-OCaml SQL engine targeting MirageOS. All implementation is in `lib/`; tests in `test/`; benchmarks in `bench/`.

## Working in this repo

**All work must go through a PR. Never commit directly to `main`.**

Push protection is enforced both locally (pre-push hook) and on the remote (Forgejo branch protection). Direct pushes to `main` will be rejected.

### Starting work on a task

Always create a git worktree so your work is isolated from `main`:

```sh
git worktree add .worktrees/<short-name> -b <branch-name>
```

Branch naming: `feat/NNN-description`, `fix/NNN-description`, `cleanup/NNN-description` where NNN is the Forgejo issue number. Example: `feat/381-btree-cursor`.

Worktrees live in `.worktrees/` which is gitignored. After the branch is created, `cd` into the worktree and do all work there.

**Worktree container permission**: the container user can't write into a worktree unless you chmod it first:

```sh
chmod 777 .worktrees/<short-name>
```

**Never use `git stash` — `refs/stash` is shared across every worktree in the repo.** It is not per-worktree. Several agents routinely work in sibling worktrees at once, and a `stash push` in one followed by a `stash pop` in another hands the second agent the *first* one's changes and silently empties its tree. This happened on 2026-08-01 between the #527 and #514 agents: uncommitted `lib/sql/exec.ml` work crossed between worktrees in both directions, and both agents spent time on recovery instead of the task.

To measure before/after numbers, use any of these instead:

```sh
cp lib/sql/exec.ml /tmp/exec.ml.good     # then restore with cp
git diff > /tmp/wip.patch                # then git checkout -- <files>, re-apply later
git commit                               # a WIP checkpoint on your own branch, then git checkout HEAD~1 -- lib/
```

Commit early on your own branch regardless. An uncommitted tree is the only thing at risk.

### Building and testing

Never call `dune` directly on the host. All OCaml build commands run inside the dev container:

```sh
# build
podman run --rm -v "$(pwd):/workspace:z" -w /workspace granary-dev dune build

# test
podman run --rm -v "$(pwd):/workspace:z" -w /workspace granary-dev dune test

# specific test
podman run --rm -v "$(pwd):/workspace:z" -w /workspace granary-dev dune test test/test_foo.exe
```

From inside a worktree, substitute the worktree path for `$(pwd)`.

### Formatting

**Use `scripts/check-fmt.sh` — it is the canonical local equivalent of CI's `dune build @fmt` gate.** It self-wraps podman (no manual `podman run`), runs the pinned ocamlformat over every `.ml`/`.mli` in `lib/ test/ bin/ bench/`, prints a unified diff for each deviation, and exits non-zero. Run it from the repo or worktree root:

```sh
sh scripts/check-fmt.sh          # check; exits 1 and prints diffs on any deviation
sh scripts/check-fmt.sh --fix    # rewrite the offending files in place
```

Read its final summary line, not just the exit code:

- `✓ … parity with CI's @fmt gate` — OCaml sources **and** dune files verified.
- `◐ … Dune files UNVERIFIED` — OCaml sources are clean but the dune-file check was skipped (see below). Exits 0; **not** full parity with CI.

Why not the raw tools:

- `dune build @fmt` is the real gate and works in the **main checkout**, but inside a **worktree** it aborts with `fatal: not a git repository` (the worktree's `.git` is a file pointing outside the container mount). It only consults git when it has a change to *promote*, so in a worktree it passes silently while everything is clean and fails only once a file deviates — success there proves nothing.
- `ocamlformat --check` reports a mismatch through the **exit code only**, printing nothing at all. Testing its captured output for emptiness reports every file as falsely clean. This trap sank five PRs (#213, #253, #277, #287, #308) before the script existed.
- **`dune format-dune-file` is NOT equivalent to `@fmt` for dune files** — verified 2026-07-30: on `dune-project` it wants 47 lines changed (blank lines between stanzas, dependency constraints rewrapped) that `@fmt` accepts as-is. Do not use it to "fix" dune files; it also makes the `diff`-expects-nothing check a false failure.
- A hand-rolled `podman run … ocamlformat --inplace` **fails silently**: under rootless podman the image's default `opam` user maps to an unrelated subuid, so every checkout file looks root-owned and `--inplace` exits 2 without writing. The script passes `--user 0` (host user → container root), which writes correctly and preserves `tej:tej` ownership. If you must invoke a container by hand and need it to *write* into the checkout, pass `--user 0` too.

The pre-commit hook runs format checks automatically on staged `.ml`/`.mli` files.

### Before pushing: dune-file formatting + merlint

The CI **lint** job runs `dune build @fmt` (dune-file formatting *and* ocamlformat) plus `merlint`. Formatting only your `.ml`/`.mli` is **not** enough — CI still fails on unformatted `dune` files or merlint findings.

```sh
# formatting (both .ml/.mli and dune files) — see above
sh scripts/check-fmt.sh

# merlint — run from the workspace root; expect 0 issues for your files
podman run --rm -v "$(pwd):/workspace:z" -w /workspace granary-dev merlint
```

**If you touched a `dune` or `dune-project` file while working in a worktree**, `check-fmt.sh` will report `◐ … Dune files UNVERIFIED`. To actually verify them before pushing, run the real gate in the main checkout (it needs no worktree state — the dune files are what matter):

```sh
cd /home/tej/projects/sqlite_ocaml_port   # the main checkout, not a worktree
podman run --rm -v "$(pwd):/workspace:z" -w /workspace granary-dev dune build @fmt
```

merlint enforces (among others): max nesting depth 4, every library module has a `.mli`, an abstract `type t` has a `pp`, and every public `val` in an `.mli` has a `(** … *)` doc comment (not `(* … *)`). It ignores the pre-existing `sqlite3 not found` build warning and still reports.

### Dead-code analysis

`dead_code_analyzer` is in the dev image and is **advisory, not a CI gate**.
Run it before a release or when pruning, and always after `dune build @check` —
a plain `dune build` emits one test `.cmt`, which makes the whole public API
look dead (185 findings instead of 56). Note that ~19 findings are `pp`
functions that merlint *requires*; the two linters collide there. Full
instructions, the current baseline, and the OCaml 5.4 fork pin are in
`docs/DEAD_CODE.md`.

### Coverage

`dune runtest --instrument-with bisect_ppx` works (verified on 5.4). Two
prerequisites, both of which the `coverage.yml` workflow also applies:

- `bisect_ppx` must be pinned to the unmerged upstream PR that supports the
  OCaml 5.2+ AST — the released 2.8.3 caps `ppxlib < 0.36`, which is
  incompatible with the `lwt_ppx 6.1` / `ppxlib 0.38` this project needs (#166).
- The `bench_*` timing gates must be neutralized; instrumentation slows
  everything enough that they fail near-deterministically.

```sh
podman run --rm -v "$(pwd):/workspace:z" -w /workspace \
  -e GRANARY_BENCH_MIN_SPEEDUP=0 -e GRANARY_BENCH_PARALLEL_MAX=1000000 \
  -e GRANARY_BENCH_MAX_WRITER_S=1000000 -e GRANARY_BENCH_MAX_RATIO=1000000 \
  granary-dev bash -c '
    opam pin add -y -k git bisect_ppx \
      "https://github.com/patricoferris/bisect_ppx.git#7061d643ff492b0045796357ee6917ded21fb1f0"
    dune runtest --instrument-with bisect_ppx
    bisect-ppx-report html -o _coverage_report/ $(find _build -name "*.coverage")
  '
```

Handwritten coverage (excluding the generated parser/lexer) is ~80%; CI gates
tags at 75%. Note the CI image ships **mawk** and has neither `python3` nor
`bc` — keep report post-processing to portable awk.

### Opening a PR

When your work is ready:

```sh
git push origin <branch-name>
~/.local/bin/forgejo pr create IoTReadyNext/granary \
  --title="feat(#NNN): short description" \
  --head=<branch-name> \
  --base=main \
  --body="$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- what changed and why

## Test plan

EOF
)"
```

### Filing issues

"File an issue" means Forgejo (`IoTReadyNext/granary`), not GitHub or any third-party URL.

```sh
~/.local/bin/forgejo issue create IoTReadyNext/granary --title="..." --body="..."
```

### Testing standards

- Target 100% line coverage on every module.
- Add QCheck property tests for every non-trivial function (see existing tests for patterns).
- Tests that require real SQLite live in `test/test_sqlite_compare.ml` (~4k lines) and skip gracefully when `sqlite3` is not in `PATH` — its header comment has the exact `podman run` invocation that mounts the host `sqlite3` and its libs into the container. **There is no `test/compare_sqlite/` directory**; that path was in this file for a while and sent agents looking for a harness they concluded did not exist. The separate `GRANARY_TEST_SQLITE` env var gates only the slow TPC-C smoke run in `test/test_tpcc_smoke.ml`.
- Granary is **inspired by** SQLite, not a port of it. When pinning a behaviour that differs from SQLite, record the divergence deliberately rather than assuming parity is the goal — e.g. every PRIMARY KEY column implies NOT NULL here, where SQLite enforces that only for `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` (#530).
