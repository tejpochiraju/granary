# granary — Agent Guide

Pure-OCaml SQL engine targeting MirageOS. All implementation is in `lib/`; tests in `test/`; benchmarks in `bench/`.

## Working in this repo

**All work must go through a PR. Never commit directly to `main`.**

Push protection is enforced both locally (pre-push hook) and on the remote (Forgejo branch protection). Direct pushes to `main` will be rejected.

### Starting work on a task

Always create a git worktree so your work is isolated from `main`:

```sh
git worktree add .worktrees/<short-name> -b <branch-name>
```

Branch naming: `feat/NNN-description`, `fix/NNN-description`, `cleanup/NNN-description` where NNN is the Forgejo issue number. Example: `feat/381-btree-cursor`.

Worktrees live in `.worktrees/` which is gitignored. After the branch is created, `cd` into the worktree and do all work there.

**Worktree container permission**: the container user can't write into a worktree unless you chmod it first:

```sh
chmod 777 .worktrees/<short-name>
```

**Never use `git stash`.** `refs/stash` is one repo-wide stack, not per-worktree, and several agents work in sibling worktrees at once — a `pop` in one worktree can apply another's changes and silently empty its tree (2026-08-01, #527 and #514).

To measure before/after numbers, use one of the three alternatives below — they are a menu, not a sequence. `SP` is your session scratchpad directory and `529` stands for your worktree; set both to your own:

```sh
SP=<your session scratchpad>; WT=529   # prefix every scratch file with $WT

# 1. WIP commit — preferred: no shared namespace to collide in
git commit -m wip
git checkout HEAD~1 -- lib/        # old code
git checkout HEAD   -- lib/        # back to WIP

# 2. or: patch aside
git add -N .                       # so new files are seen
git diff HEAD > "$SP/$WT-wip.patch"

# 3. or: copy aside
cp lib/sql/exec.ml "$SP/$WT-exec.ml.good"
```

**Name every scratch file after your worktree** — `$SP/529-exec.ml.good`, never `$SP/exec.ml.good`. The session scratchpad is shared by *all* agents in the session, not one per worktree. On 2026-08-01 two agents each saved `exec.ml.good` there; the second overwrote the first, and the first restored the other's `exec.ml` into its own tree. A generic filename in a shared directory is a stash by another name — `refs/stash` was one instance of the pattern, not the pattern.

Plain `git diff` captures neither staged nor untracked changes — use `git diff HEAD` after `git add -N`. `git checkout HEAD~1 -- lib/` also will not delete files that exist only in the WIP commit; remove those by hand. Commit early on your own branch regardless: an uncommitted tree is the only thing at risk.

After any recovery, verify with `md5sum` against a known-good source rather than assuming — both incidents were caught that way, and in both the timestamps looked innocent.

### Building and testing

Never call `dune` directly on the host. All OCaml build commands run inside the dev container:

```sh
# build
podman run --rm -v "$(pwd):/workspace:z" -w /workspace granary-dev dune build

# test
podman run --rm -v "$(pwd):/workspace:z" -w /workspace granary-dev dune test

# specific test
podman run --rm -v "$(pwd):/workspace:z" -w /workspace granary-dev dune test test/test_foo.exe
```

From inside a worktree, substitute the worktree path for `$(pwd)`.

### Timing and scaling gates (`GRANARY_BENCH_*`)

Several tests assert a wall-clock ratio or ceiling rather than a value. They
guard regressions that are invisible to a correctness test — an O(n) drain, an
O(n²) bulk insert, a lost reader/writer overlap:

| test | guards | gate | neutralizer |
|---|---|---|---|
| `test_fts_scaling` | #233 FTS `cursor_open` drain | 3x index < 2.0x slower | `GRANARY_BENCH_MAX_RATIO` |
| `test_insert_scaling` | #228/#229 O(n²) insert, full-scan lookup | ratio < 2.5, speedup ≥ 4.0 | `GRANARY_BENCH_MAX_RATIO`, `GRANARY_BENCH_MIN_SPEEDUP` |
| `bench_wal_fsync_overlap` | #149/#159 fsync overlap | overlap ≤ 1.15, speedup ≥ 1.2 | `GRANARY_BENCH_MIN_SPEEDUP` |
| `bench_wal_reader_scaling` | #149 parallel-read regression | parallel ≤ 2.0x serial | `GRANARY_BENCH_PARALLEL_MAX` |
| `bench_slow_read_yield` | reader starving the writer | writer ≤ 3.0 s | `GRANARY_BENCH_MAX_WRITER_S` |

**Where they run armed.** `ci.yml`, `coverage.yml` and `cross-arch.yml` — all
six files, Forgejo and GitHub — neutralize every one of them, because those
jobs share a loaded runner with every other PR. The single *scheduled* job that
runs them with their ceilings live is `.forgejo/workflows/bench-nightly.yml`:
`dune runtest --force -j 1`, no `GRANARY_BENCH_*` neutralizer, on the
self-hosted runner, reporting via an auto-filed issue rather than blocking PRs
(#549). It shares the `nightly` concurrency group with `jepsen-nightly.yml` so
the two heavy nightlies queue instead of perturbing each other's timings.

The `.github/` mirror of that file is **manual-only** (`workflow_dispatch`, no
`schedule`) and that is deliberate: GitHub's `ubuntu-latest` is a shared 2-core
VM, so a scheduled armed run there would auto-file a recurring public issue
nobody acts on and train everyone to ignore the marker — #549's disease, not
its cure. Treat a red run there as weak evidence.

Do not "fix" a red nightly by adding a neutralizer to that workflow — that is
the honour system #549 removed. Anywhere else, these gates are armed only when
*you* run the suite locally and read the result.

**Tuning knobs, not gates.** `GRANARY_BENCH_TRIALS` (best-of-N draws;
`test_fts_scaling` default 9, `bench_wal_fsync_overlap` default 3) and
`GRANARY_BENCH_REPS` (`test_fts_scaling` iterations per timed loop, default
500) only reduce variance — they cannot make a failing test pass. On a loaded
box, raise these rather than disarming the ceiling.

If a gate fails on your box, check `uptime` first: sibling agents running
suites in parallel are the usual cause, and the gates print their per-trial
numbers so you can tell noise from a regression.

### Formatting

**Use `scripts/check-fmt.sh` — it is the canonical local equivalent of CI's `dune build @fmt` gate.** It self-wraps podman (no manual `podman run`), runs the pinned ocamlformat over every `.ml`/`.mli` in `lib/ test/ bin/ bench/`, prints a unified diff for each deviation, and exits non-zero. Run it from the repo or worktree root:

```sh
sh scripts/check-fmt.sh          # check; exits 1 and prints diffs on any deviation
sh scripts/check-fmt.sh --fix    # rewrite the offending files in place
```

Read its final summary line, not just the exit code:

- `✓ … parity with CI's @fmt gate` — OCaml sources **and** dune files verified.
- `◐ … Dune files UNVERIFIED` — OCaml sources are clean but the dune-file check was skipped (see below). Exits 0; **not** full parity with CI.

Why not the raw tools:

- `dune build @fmt` is the real gate and works in the **main checkout**, but inside a **worktree** it aborts with `fatal: not a git repository` (the worktree's `.git` is a file pointing outside the container mount). It only consults git when it has a change to *promote*, so in a worktree it passes silently while everything is clean and fails only once a file deviates — success there proves nothing.
- `ocamlformat --check` reports a mismatch through the **exit code only**, printing nothing at all. Testing its captured output for emptiness reports every file as falsely clean. This trap sank five PRs (#213, #253, #277, #287, #308) before the script existed.
- **`dune format-dune-file` is NOT equivalent to `@fmt` for dune files** — verified 2026-07-30: on `dune-project` it wants 47 lines changed (blank lines between stanzas, dependency constraints rewrapped) that `@fmt` accepts as-is. Do not use it to "fix" dune files; it also makes the `diff`-expects-nothing check a false failure.
- A hand-rolled `podman run … ocamlformat --inplace` **fails silently**: under rootless podman the image's default `opam` user maps to an unrelated subuid, so every checkout file looks root-owned and `--inplace` exits 2 without writing. The script passes `--user 0` (host user → container root), which writes correctly and preserves `tej:tej` ownership. If you must invoke a container by hand and need it to *write* into the checkout, pass `--user 0` too.

The pre-commit hook runs format checks automatically on staged `.ml`/`.mli` files.

### Before pushing: dune-file formatting + merlint

The CI **lint** job runs `dune build @fmt` (dune-file formatting *and* ocamlformat) plus `merlint`. Formatting only your `.ml`/`.mli` is **not** enough — CI still fails on unformatted `dune` files or merlint findings.

```sh
# formatting (both .ml/.mli and dune files) — see above
sh scripts/check-fmt.sh

# merlint — run from the workspace root; expect 0 issues for your files
podman run --rm -v "$(pwd):/workspace:z" -w /workspace granary-dev merlint
```

**If you touched a `dune` or `dune-project` file while working in a worktree**, `check-fmt.sh` will report `◐ … Dune files UNVERIFIED`. To actually verify them before pushing, run the real gate in the main checkout (it needs no worktree state — the dune files are what matter):

```sh
cd /home/tej/projects/sqlite_ocaml_port   # the main checkout, not a worktree
podman run --rm -v "$(pwd):/workspace:z" -w /workspace granary-dev dune build @fmt
```

merlint enforces (among others): max nesting depth 4, every library module has a `.mli`, an abstract `type t` has a `pp`, and every public `val` in an `.mli` has a `(** … *)` doc comment (not `(* … *)`). It ignores the pre-existing `sqlite3 not found` build warning and still reports.

### Dead-code analysis

`dead_code_analyzer` is in the dev image and is **advisory, not a CI gate**.
Run it before a release or when pruning, and always after `dune build @check` —
a plain `dune build` emits one test `.cmt`, which makes the whole public API
look dead (185 findings instead of 56). Note that ~19 findings are `pp`
functions that merlint *requires*; the two linters collide there. Full
instructions, the current baseline, and the OCaml 5.4 fork pin are in
`docs/DEAD_CODE.md`.

### Coverage

`dune runtest --instrument-with bisect_ppx` works (verified on 5.4). Two
prerequisites, both of which the `coverage.yml` workflow also applies:

- `bisect_ppx` must be pinned to the unmerged upstream PR that supports the
  OCaml 5.2+ AST — the released 2.8.3 caps `ppxlib < 0.36`, which is
  incompatible with the `lwt_ppx 6.1` / `ppxlib 0.38` this project needs (#166).
- The `bench_*` timing gates must be neutralized; instrumentation slows
  everything enough that they fail near-deterministically.

```sh
podman run --rm -v "$(pwd):/workspace:z" -w /workspace \
  -e GRANARY_BENCH_MIN_SPEEDUP=0 -e GRANARY_BENCH_PARALLEL_MAX=1000000 \
  -e GRANARY_BENCH_MAX_WRITER_S=1000000 -e GRANARY_BENCH_MAX_RATIO=1000000 \
  granary-dev bash -c '
    opam pin add -y -k git bisect_ppx \
      "https://github.com/patricoferris/bisect_ppx.git#7061d643ff492b0045796357ee6917ded21fb1f0"
    dune runtest --instrument-with bisect_ppx
    bisect-ppx-report html -o _coverage_report/ $(find _build -name "*.coverage")
  '
```

Handwritten coverage (excluding the generated parser/lexer) is ~80%; CI gates
tags at 75%. Note the CI image ships **mawk** and has neither `python3` nor
`bc` — keep report post-processing to portable awk.

```

### Testing standards

- Target 100% line coverage on every module.
- Add QCheck property tests for every non-trivial function (see existing tests for patterns).
- Tests that require real SQLite live in `test/test_sqlite_compare.ml`; they skip gracefully via `sqlite3_available ()` (`:18`) when `sqlite3` is not in `PATH`, and its header comment has the exact `podman run` invocation that mounts the host `sqlite3` and its libs into the container. **There is no `test/compare_sqlite/` directory** — that path was in this file for a while and sent agents looking for a harness they concluded did not exist.
- Nothing in the tree reads `GRANARY_TEST_SQLITE`; it is a phantom invented by the same stale sentence. The SQLite comparison tests gate on `sqlite3` in `PATH`; the slow TPC-C smoke run gates on `GRANARY_TPCC_SMOKE` (`test/test_tpcc_smoke.ml:238`).
- Granary is **inspired by** SQLite, not a port of it. When pinning a behaviour that differs from SQLite, record the divergence deliberately rather than assuming parity is the goal — e.g. since #530 every PRIMARY KEY column implies NOT NULL, whichever way the key is spelled, where SQLite leaves PK columns nullable on *rowid* tables (its legacy behaviour; it does enforce PK NOT NULL on `WITHOUT ROWID` tables, which this engine also supports). `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ... PRIMARY KEY` is refused outright for the same reason: that path built no backing index, so it could only ever have produced a "primary key" that was not one.
- **NaN is a value here, and it sorts below every number (#536, decided 2026-08-02).**
  SQLite has no NaN at all: `sqlite3_bind_double(NaN)` binds NULL, and a NaN
  expression result is NULL, so `o >= ?` bound to NaN is *unknown* and returns
  no rows. Granary instead keeps NaN as a real value in a total order, and
  diverges from SQLite in **both** directions — `o >= NaN` returns every row,
  `o <= NaN` returns none. Two mechanisms have to agree for that to be sound:
  - `Exec.cmp_result` promotes cross-type numeric operands with `Float.compare`,
    whose total order puts NaN below `neg_infinity`.
  - `Index_key.encode_value` writes NaN as the single `0x00` NULL/NaN byte,
    which also sorts below every other key.

  **They agree that NaN sorts below every number, and that — not blanket
  agreement — is what keeps this from being a rows-lost bug.** (They do *not*
  agree about NaN vs NULL; see below. That costs no rows on the read path,
  because a seek over the shared `0x00` prefix still runs the residual
  predicate.) A seek and its residual predicate can never disagree about where
  NaN sits relative to a number, so no future change may move one of the two
  without the other, or an index seek will start skipping rows the predicate
  would have kept. Option A (fold NaN to NULL at the value-ingress points,
  matching SQLite) remains the only variant worth the disruption; option B
  (NULL comparison, unchanged storage) was rejected precisely because it breaks
  that agreement.

  `nan_and_infinite_bounds_are_sound` in `test/test_range_bound_517.ml` pins it
  (300 rows for a NaN lower bound, 0 for an upper one).

  **The agreement is only about NaN vs *numbers*.** The rest of the engine was
  surveyed when #536 was decided, and NaN vs *NULL* is where the two levels part
  company — `Exec.compare_values` puts `NULL < NaN < every number`, while the
  index encoding makes NaN and NULL the same `0x00` byte, i.e. *equal*. The
  value-level answers are all coherent with the decided order and need no
  change:
  - **ORDER BY** (`compare_with_nulls`) places NULLs by an explicit flag and
    sends NaN to `compare_values`, so NaN sorts after NULLs and before every
    other real.
  - **DISTINCT** and hash joins dedup on `row_key`'s `%h` rendering, so all NaNs
    collapse to one and none collapses into NULL.
  - **GROUP BY** / window PARTITION BY group on `compare_values = 0`, so two
    NaNs group together and NaN never groups with NULL — consistent with
    DISTINCT.
  - **MIN/MAX** skip NULLs and use `compare_values`, so `MIN` over a REAL column
    containing NaN returns NaN and `MAX` only does when NaN is the sole
    non-NULL value.

  **Index-keyed uniqueness is the one that does NOT agree, and it is a real
  bug — #578, not part of this decision.** The UNIQUE NULL exemption
  (`any_null_val`) tests the *value*, so a NaN is correctly not exempted; but
  the conflict probe then compares *encoded bytes*, where NaN's key is
  byte-identical to NULL's. So `INSERT NULL` then `INSERT NaN` raises a spurious
  `UNIQUE constraint failed`, while the reverse order succeeds. Do not "fix"
  that by making the exemption byte-based — that would silently exempt NaN from
  uniqueness altogether. **Option C should not be treated as fully settled while
  that stands**: an order-dependent `UNIQUE` on any nullable REAL column is a
  live defect, and if it is fixed by giving NaN its own tag byte, the "NaN is a
  value in a total order" position gets stronger rather than weaker.

  One further comparator defect surfaced in the same survey and is *not*
  NaN-specific: `Exec.compare_values` returns `0` for any int-vs-real pair (its
  `| _, _ -> 0` catch-all), while `Exec.cmp_result` promotes through
  `Float.compare`. Strict column typing hides this for stored columns, but
  `ORDER BY` over a mixed *computed* column returns rows unsorted. Tracked as
  #579. There are four independent value comparators in the tree
  (`compare_values`, `cmp_result`, `row_key`'s string rendering, and
  `Reactive_view.value_compare`) and they do not all agree.

- A column's `not_null` no longer records *why* it is set — declared or implied by a primary key — because #530 folded both into the one stored bit. Anything that removes a key therefore cannot restore the column's original nullability: `ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN` on a composite-PK member clears `primary_key` on the survivors but deliberately leaves `not_null`, since the engine is still enforcing it. Two bits (or an origin tag) is the fix if this ever needs to be exact — not cleverness at the ALTER sites.

### One `Db.t`, one explicit transaction (#555)

A `Db.t` carries a single explicit-transaction slot and every statement resolves
its transaction from it. **Autocommit sharing across fibers is fine and stays
fine** — `test_concurrent_rmw_223.ml` and `test_multifiber_stress.ml` both share
one handle across fibers and are correct. Explicit transactions are the problem:
two fibers cannot hold two.

Since #555 a `BEGIN` that arrives while another explicit transaction is active
fails *and* **poisons the handle**. While poisoned, every statement — read,
write, DDL, `SAVEPOINT`, prepared `run`/`iter`, and `COMMIT` — is rejected with a
`Runtime` error. `ROLLBACK` is the sole exit: it aborts whatever transaction was
in flight and clears the poison, after which the handle is fully usable.
`Db.transaction_poisoned` exposes the flag.

**The poison narrows the hazard; it does not close it.** It covers the window
between the failed `BEGIN` and the first `ROLLBACK` — and `ROLLBACK` is the
prescribed recovery, so the window closes by design. Past it the original
contamination is reachable with the fibers exchanged: the recovering fiber
`BEGIN`s afresh, and the fiber whose transaction was aborted — never told —
writes into the new one and commits it. That is **#584**, pinned as a canary by
`residual_584` in `test_txn.ml`. The enabling change for a real fix is **#585**
(a scoped `Db.with_transaction`, giving the engine an extent to attach an owner
token to); **#555** option 1 (a session object) is what an OLTP throughput
number needs. Do not read the poison as permission to share a handle.

It also dooms the *winner's* transaction — the engine cannot tell the two fibers
apart, so it cannot let `COMMIT` through without letting the wrong fiber's
`COMMIT` through.

Under ATTACH, poisoning is **per-handle**: each attached schema is its own
`Db.t` with its own slot, `BEGIN` routes to the active schema, and a poisoned
`aux` does not stop statements routed to `main`. Three consequences are wired in
deliberately — `Db.transaction_poisoned` ORs over the attached sub-handles (or
it would answer `false` on a genuinely poisoned connection), and both routing
statements that could carry a caller *away* from a poisoned schema are refused:
`PRAGMA active_database = …` (or the recovering `ROLLBACK` would route to the
wrong schema and answer "no active transaction" while the poisoned one still
held its writer lock) and `DETACH DATABASE` (which would otherwise drop the
sub-handle and its transaction — a clean outcome, but a *second* exit from the
poisoned state, making "ROLLBACK is the sole exit" false).

**The ATTACH story is not closed.** #555's poison only fires on a *collision*,
and under ATTACH one `Db.t` legitimately holds two explicit-transaction slots.
A `PRAGMA active_database` switch mid-transaction therefore makes a statement
silently autocommit into the wrong schema, with `transaction_poisoned = false`
throughout — no collision, so nothing fires. Pre-existing and untouched by
#555; tracked as **#598**.

### Running explicit transactions from more than one fiber

> `WITHOUT ROWID` tables, or rowid tables where you supply the
> `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` value on every insert. A `TEXT PRIMARY KEY` or

Read that before the rest of this section. "Use explicit primary keys" was the
advice here until 2026-08-02 and it is **false** — a `TEXT PRIMARY KEY` with
caller-supplied values is an explicit primary key, and it is the worst case in
the matrix, not an exception to it.

`create_worker_handle` is nonetheless the only mechanism available, and the
mechanism itself is sound: it is `of_store` over the *same* `Store.t`, so each
handle gets its own `explicit_txn` while sharing the store's single-writer
`Rwlock`. A second fiber's `BEGIN` **blocks** until the first commits rather than
contaminating it, and neither handle is ever poisoned. (This also corrects #555's
premise that "a second `Db.t` over the same path would be a second lock with no
mutual exclusion" — true of a second `open_file`, false here.)

**What #589 actually does.** Each handle gets a *fresh catalog*, and a catalog
caches `next_rowid`. Two handles hold two counters over one data tree and neither
invalidates the other, so an `INSERT` with an engine-assigned rowid reuses a
rowid the other handle already committed. Measured across the table shapes:

| shape | result |
|---|---|
| `CREATE TABLE t (b TEXT)` — plain rowid, the commonest shape | 1 row where there should be 2 |
| `a INTEGER PRIMARY KEY`, engine-assigned | 1 row |
| `a INTEGER PRIMARY KEY`, **caller-supplied** values | correct |
| `a INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT` | 1 row; `sqlite_sequence` reads `1` on both handles |
| `k TEXT PRIMARY KEY`, caller-supplied keys | 1 row **plus index corruption** |
| `WITHOUT ROWID` | correct |

For `TEXT PRIMARY KEY` the consequence is **wrong query answers**, not row loss:
the index keeps a phantom entry for the overwritten key pointing at the reused
rowid, so `WHERE k = 'k1'` returns a row whose `k` is `k2`, a secondary-index
seek does the same, and re-inserting `'k1'` fails with a phantom
`UNIQUE constraint failed`. Pinned by `worker_handle_text_pk_corruption`.

It is symmetric and unbounded, not one-shot: a worker created *after* the
parent's rows snapshots correctly, and then the **parent** goes stale and
overwrites the worker's row. Three handles and five inserts leave two rows. It
persists to disk, survives close/reopen, and explicit transactions on both
handles do not help — it is not a race, and the writer lock is irrelevant.

The other limits, none of which corrupt anything:

- DDL on one handle is invisible to the other's schema cache (same fresh-catalog
  cause).
- Reactive views, ATTACHed schemas and the active schema are per-handle.
- Write transactions *serialize* on the shared lock rather than overlapping, and
  a read-only transaction does not overlap a writer either.

`Tpcc_driver`'s one-deep worker pool predates this and serializes whole
transactions on a single handle; that is why its terminal-count sweep flatlines
by construction.
